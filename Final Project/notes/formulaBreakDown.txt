B.i = E.i + ρ.i * Sum(j=1 to n){F.i.j * B.j}

B.i is used to represent the radiosity of patch i.
    n length column vector

E.i is used to represent the emitted radiosity of patch i.
    n length column vector

ρ.i is used to represent the reflectivity of patch i.
    n length column vector

F.i.j is used to represent the form factor between patches i and j.
    n by n matrix

η is the total number of patches in the scene. (known)

if R = diag(ρ) be the diag matrix with ρ.i on the diagonal
then B = E + R * F * B
which is (I - R * F) * B = E or B = (I - R * F)^-1 * E

LINEAR ALGEBRA OPERATIONS
1. Matrix-Vector multiply
    Compute: Sum(j=1 to n){F.i.j * B.j} = y.i (CO

2. Vector-Vector multiply
    Compute ρ.i * y.i = r.i (n length column vector)

3. Vector Addition
    Compute E.i + r.i = B.new.i

Loop is:
    matrix-vector multiply -> Vector-Matrix multiply -> vector addition

Jacobi iteration
given F (nxn), E (n), ρ (n)
start with B = E

    loop until converged
        y = F * B (matrix-vector)
        r = ρ * y (vector-vector)
        B_new = E + r
        if ||B_new - B|| < not good change
            B = B_new
        else
            return

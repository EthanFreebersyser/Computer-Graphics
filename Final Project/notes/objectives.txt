0) redo your Project 4 scene as needed in order to have an appropriate
    number of tesselated flat surfaces in orientations that will be able
    to show radiosity effects (not a literal Cornell box, but take inspiration
    from that).  I'd suggest programmatically tesselating your geometry rather
    than attempting to hand-calculate anything.  You'll also potentially want
    to increase or decrease your tesselation level later on, so keep that in
    mind as you do this step.  Simplify your driving to a box and remove the driver if needed.

1) Implement Radiosity using your sources.

2) Allow the user to enable or disable radiosity so they can see the effect.
    If the effect is too subtle, you may need to artificially amplify any
    color bleed to make it more obvious, but just amplify, don't pre-color
    your objects.  The goal is to be able to see the diffuse interreflection
    as your red driving drives by different surfaces.

2.5) include any necessary camera views to help the user see the effect.

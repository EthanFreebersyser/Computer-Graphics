13/15 pts: Correct modeling of all objects (particularly normal
    vectors and material properties)

15/15 pts: Correct implementation of Phong lighting (code could
    be spread between your vertex and fragment shaders as appropriate)

15/15 pts: Correct implementation of Phong Shading (NOT Gouraud
    shading that we did in our first lighting code along)

10/10 pts: Correct implementation of headlights (must point in
    correct direction based on driving transforms)

10/10 pts: Correct implementation of emergency lights

5/ 5 pts: Correct implementation of overhead light

5/ 5 pts: Correct implementation of controls

10/10 pts: Project Check-in

11/15 pts: Good design and coding style

Comments:

-Wheels don't have correct normal vectors on either side

-Why are you manually re-implementing the normalize function
    in several places (among other similar "wet" code patterns)?
    This is part of helperfunctions and the glsl language.
    This resulted in bulkier and redundant code overall.
